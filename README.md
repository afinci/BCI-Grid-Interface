# BCI-Grid-Interface
2D Grid Interface for Error Related Potential Detection in Brain-Computer Interfaces

It basically collects EEG data by using subject's response to 2D grid interface which has 
a cursor which can go to right or left. It may go to correct or wrong direction based on subject's decision 
and it sends a trigger value which enables us to observe error related negativity.

You can find the implementation details in BCI-Grid-Interface/grid2way/Form1.cs
